          About Radical Unlearning
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We are parents and were students who have experienced the drawbacks of mainstream education: too much emphasis on learning measurement, flawed measurement techniques, carrot/stick approach, focus on memorisation, limited exploration through questioning, intense pressure of competition & many more…
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        So, we have created a framework and platform for like-minded people—mainly unschooling parents and homeschoolers in the learning community—who would like to support our principles of open, enjoyable, and effective learning.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The framework offers essential principles of learning, tools to access resources, collaborate, and contribute towards learning.
